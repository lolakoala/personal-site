    <div class="about">
      <p>I love to question everything. I have a BA in philosophy.</p>
      <p>I am energized by genuine human relationships. I live in an intentional community with five adults.</p>
      <p>I identify as genderqueer. I see gender as a social construct, and I am not about to conform to anyone's arbitrary idea of what I should or shouldn't be.</p>
      <p>I have a passion for delights of the senses. I love to create interesting combinations of flavors, colors, or words. Look for my artwork in the food I lovingly assemble, the daily-utilized canvas of my face, or in my personal musings.</p>
      <p>My quest to infiltrate the tech world via coding school began as a response to directionlessness, but is quickly pivoting to be an intruiging journey of self-discovery. Despite being a minority, I've found a place to call home.</p>
      <p>Though developing is my current career path, my true goal is to aid in the progression of rights and recognition for the marginalized. Those of racial, sexual, gender, or socioeconimoc minorities are my friends, teachers, and family. I speak up for them whenever the opportunity presents itself.</p>
      <p>I am a chameleon--wearer of many hats.<br />Barista. Florist. Entrepreneur. Yogi. Cook. Manager. Trainer. Spouse. Confidante.<br />My adaptability knows no bounds.</p>
